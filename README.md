# Garage Gate Remote

Making the dumb garage gate smart!

This is a simple project to upgrade my garage gate into a phone-controllable
gate. Overall, there are two parts involved:

## Servo that click the dumb garage remote

Most critical part. I will put some pictures later.

I'm using Johnny-five and node to control the servo.

## A set of web utils to control that servo

I'm using firebase tool sets to send command to the servo.
